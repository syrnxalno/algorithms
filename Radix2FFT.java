/*
 * The Real and Complex form of DFT (Discrete Fourier Transforms) can be used to perform frequency analysis or synthesis for any discrete and periodic signals.
 * The FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is an implementation of the DFT which may be performed quickly on modern CPUs.
 * The simplest and perhaps best-known method for computing the FFT is the Radix-2 Decimation in Time algorithm, attempted below
